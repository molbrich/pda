## Example

Assume, we have two random variables: A resistor value r and a capacitance value c. Both are independently normal distributed. 
As a choice concerning the accuracy of our calculations, we will use a second order arithmetic. 
As the first step in our program, we will initialize a Probability Distribution Arithmetic (PDA) by:
```
PDA pda(2,2);  // order: 2, : independent variables: 2
```
This also implicitly initializes two standard normal distributed random variables Delta_0 and Delta_1.
They are called Basis Random Variables (BRVs) and are statistically independent.
Let us come back to the resistor and the capacitance:
The random variable r should have a nominal value of 200 and a deviation of 50. This can be represented by

r = 200 + 50 Delta_0

using the BRV Delta_0.
Let the nominal value of the random variable c be 0.01 and the deviation 0.001. Then, c can be represented as

c = 0.01 + 0.001 \Delta_1

with Delta_1 being the second BRV.
In C++ we define two Probability Distribution Variables (PDVs) for r and c:
```
PDV r(pda, 200); // Nominal value of r is 200
PDV c(pda, 0.01); // Nominal value of c is 0.01
```
and add the distributed part to them:
```
r.setDeltaCoeff(0, 50);   // set deviation of r to 50 (using Delta_0)
c.setDeltaCoeff(1, 0.001); // set deviation of c to 0.01 (using Delta_1)
```
Then, we can calculate the time t as the product of r and c:
```
PDV t(pda);
t = r * c;
```
Now, the variable t contains the whole distribution information of r * c.
E.g., we can determine the mean and variance of t by
```
std::cout << "Mean of t: " << t.getMean() << std::endl;
std::cout << "Variance of t: " << t.getVariance() << std::endl;
```

Please have a look at the hello-world.cpp program in examples/hello-world as an other running example.
